TODO
- Integration with KDE KIO job control. May need another big refactoring, probably using other language.

Version 1.4.2
- Fixed formats list parser - now works not only with youtube
- Last element in formats list was not shown

- regression: Download formats menu did not appear

Version 1.4
- Show error text and cancel if youtube-dl produced error on first usage attempt

Version 1.3
- Code refactoring
- Added support for external download tools

- Create or load non-existing configuration files even without any work

Version 1.2.2

- Write default term file if not found
